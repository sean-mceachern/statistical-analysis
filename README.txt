Intro to Data Science: Probability and Statistics - CSCI 3022
Sean McEachern

In this assignment we used Python to examine three topics.
1. Hypothesis testing - using the p-value to determine whether we should accept or reject a null hypothesis
2. Bootstrapping - when there is a smaller than desired amount of data, we can use python to extrapolate accurate estimations based on the limited amount of data we have
3. Simple linear regression modeling - examining a data from response and features, plot linear models over scatterplots and line plots to estimate the variance, examining the proportion of variance (r squared) and confidence intervals to better understand the accuracy of the models.

libraries used:
Numpy (np)
Matplotlib.pyplot (put)
pandas (pd)
stats (from scipy)

I used Jupyter Notebook (IDE) to complete this work. To view this product in Jupyter Notebook use the .ipynb file. Otherwise you can view the same code in the .py file as well.
