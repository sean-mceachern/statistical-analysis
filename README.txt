Intro to Data Science: Probability and Statistics - CSCI 3022
Sean McEachern

libraries used:
Numpy (np)
Matplotlib.pyplot (put)
pandas (pd)
stats (from scipy)

I used Jupyter Notebook (IDE) to complete this work. To view this product in Jupyter Notebook use the .ipynb file. Otherwise you can view the same code in the .py file as well.

HypothTesting-Bootstrapping-LinearRegression:
1. Hypothesis testing - using the p-value to determine whether we should accept or reject a null hypothesis
2. Bootstrapping - when there is a smaller than desired amount of data, we can use python to extrapolate accurate estimations based on the limited amount of data we have
3. Simple linear regression modeling - examining a data from response and features, plot linear models over scatterplots and line plots to estimate the variance, examining the proportion of variance (r squared) and confidence intervals to better understand the accuracy of the models.

BootstrapDisplay-OLSRegressionResults:
1. Plot the results of bootstrapped data on Amazon forest fires over years where data might be missing or incomplete
2. camparing the results using different features by analyzing the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models.
